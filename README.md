# WebOfTrust.DistributedConsensus 

This is a fault tolerant implementation of PoI, which is a zero energy alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW).

Proof of Identity addresses the consensus problem with a random subset of anonymised actors. We rely on the guarantee that each actor can only create N nodes and/or the ability to distinguish between more than one node owned by the same actor.

This trust is proven in the Web Verifier demos.
